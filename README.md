Sample project to demonstrate a game written with JavaScript.

## Pre-requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (I've used version `2.26.2` while writing this doc)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/) (I've used version `92.0.4515.131` while writing this doc) or Other Browser
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I've used version `14.17.3` while writing this doc)

## Installation

To install the dev dependencies, run `npm install` (or `npm i` for short.)

## Creation

For creation, it was using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I used CSS to move images and create the scenery. JavaScript was used to perform the game's functions.
